            <p class="question">
              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
              I think I learn to be more patient if finding a hard task, more critical thinking on research and problem solving of the task and on how I look on the task. Furthermore, regarding my ego, that my mindset was keeping the tasks done on time and managing the time with work and study quite hard. The another one, It is my anxiety that come often to my mind due to what if I’m failed on the study and my future. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
               What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
            </p>
            <p>
              Values give a reason and motivation to learn and make things. It helps guide what we do and why we do it. Empathy helps understand other people's ideas and feelings, which is important when making things for others to use.Self-awareness helps us understand ourselves and our own ideas and feelings. It helps us get better by thinking about what we did and what we can do better.
            </p>
            <p>Having these qualities makes learning and programming more meaningful and impactful.</p>

            <p class="question">
              What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m surprised that I wrote a lot compared my normal daily life, it felt back as University student again. However, new thing I learned about the emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity, growth mindset and how to think like programmer. Heaps stuff that need to absorb and review again, but I got some basic understanding on those materials.

            <p class="question">
              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
              In my opinion, it is the time management between the tech and core. My workflow is to find the easiest one first to start the Sprint. Normally, I will start with tech, first and then core learning. I got panic if I did not finish the tech first because I know the core learning will take time learn and also I need to write long paragraphs for the blog.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </p>
            <p>
              I think it is important to balance out, not only just the tech learning but also the self-development as to keep our mind growth and as self-reflection to ourself and better know about ourself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not waste of time, I found this quite new for me, normally I do is about technical things, for instance, taking photo and editing photos when I was photographer. Therefore, It is really good for to try this one, as to improve my self-development.
