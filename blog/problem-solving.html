              In Javascript, The Bracket method is a way to add or access properties in an object. Instead of using the dot notation ( object.property ), you use square brackets ( [] ) and put the property name inside them ( object["property"] ).

            <h3>Overlooked small but significant problem</h3>
            <p class="question">Problem</p>
            <p>
              I have an empty object called (dataTwo), and would  like to fill in one property and its value ( name : 'Ado' ) to the object. I was curious to try “ Bracket Method “. The picture below, shows that I try using wrong way of “Bracket Method” practice. Because  when I check the output it gives me no property called ‘name’, instead of giving value (‘Ado').

            <p class="question">Solution</p>
            <p>
              After doing some googling and research regarding to the problem. I realised that I made mistake, the solution on this problem is that I should type code, shown on the below picture.

              A little change can make difference, I should be more careful with syntax and always check the JS code references from other website. On the other hand, I tried to do quite different experiments with the Bracket Method, I found that the benefit using that method is you can add a property with a name that is not a valid identifier , for instance, it has spaces or special characters. In which you probably cannot use it with the Dot Notation.

              In this context, I want add more properties and values of each property into an empty object. At this time I use the Dot Notation. However, I ended up making repetition code to add to the object.

              I was feeling that I was not right enough to do repetition on this and I start questioning to myself how to solve it with just one line code. I started to googling and do some research. Finally I found it the way to do that.

             The code is tidy and clean. I felt really good after finding how to do that. It was a learning that if whenever I try to solve the problem with code and I make repetition and long code, it is a sign that I need to do more research and find the best solution.
