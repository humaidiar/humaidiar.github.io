            <p>Mostly, when I’m on duty as an event photographer. There is situation that you have to make an ethical decision.
              When I’m taking a person portrait or group photo. Often time, I ask for their permission which is necessary.
              For instance, if the photo is used for the event organiser’s marketing asset in instagram.
              Therefore, it is compulsory to ask permission or create a model release form, before we are taking some photos. 
              I respect their privacy and value. However, I try to not make an conflict in the future.

              I was born in Indonesia which is multi-cultural and religion nation and Islam is the majority of religion in the country.
               I was grown up in conservative islamic family. I was isolated not knowing what was happening out of Indonesia. 
               So my mind has not comprehended what the western culture was like. 
               Then I moved to New Zealand for study in Bachelor Degree. 
               It was opening my mind. It changed me the way of my thinking in term of human interaction and behaviour. 
               It teaches me how to be authentic and hold my principles that I believed, but I can blend with New Zealand’s culture. 
               It was really amazing journey what I have been through.

              Based on my test result from <a href="https://psytests.org/result?v=ipioJ3B2cTRSO" style="font-size: normal;">psytest.org</a> I did. 
              I found that I have relatively high score on compassion, respectfulness, trust, organisation, productiveness, responsibility, intellectual curiosity and open-mindedness. 
              Those some values were highly related what I experienced during my learning journey. 
              How I was so organised with my learning and The way I dig dipper with the problem along the journey, where my curiosity was trying to figure out to solve the problem. 
              On the other hand, How I respect my college and facilitator during my study.
