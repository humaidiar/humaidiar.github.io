            <p class="question">
              Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now ?
            </p>
            <p>Mostly, when I'm on duty as an event photographer. There is situation that you have to make an ethical decision.
              When I’m taking a person portrait or group photo. Often time, I ask for their permission which is necessary.
              For instance, if the photo is used for the event organiser’s marketing asset in instagram.
              Therefore, it is compulsory to ask permission or create a model release form, before we are taking some photos. 
              I respect their privacy and value. However, I try to not make an conflict in the future.

              Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity ?
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born in Indonesia which is multi-cultural and religion nation and Islam is the majority of religion in the country.
               I was grown up in conservative islamic family. I was isolated not knowing what was happening out of Indonesia. 
               So my mind has not comprehended what the western culture was like. 
               Then I moved to New Zealand for study in Bachelor Degree. 
               It was opening my mind. It changed me the way of my thinking in term of human interaction and behaviour. 
               It teaches me how to be authentic and hold my principles that I believed, but I can blend with New Zealand’s culture. 
               It was really amazing journey what I have been through.

            <p class ="question">
              Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey ?
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on my test result from <a href="https://psytests.org/result?v=ipioJ3B2cTRSO">psytest.org</a> I did. 
              I found that I have relatively high score on compassion, respectfulness, trust, organisation, productiveness, responsibility, intellectual curiosity and open-mindedness. 
              Those some values were highly related what I experienced during my learning journey. 
              How I was so organised with my learning and The way I dig dipper with the problem along the journey, where my curiosity was trying to figure out to solve the problem. 
              On the other hand, How I respect my college and facilitator during my study.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question">
              Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey ?
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on my partner’s feedback regarding my weekness in learning. I realised, that I’m quite hard to focus on sitting in front of the screen for long periodic time. 
              For instance, often every 10 minutes I’ll go find something else, like going to cook, make a coffee or toilet. Then, I tried to do mix, not just sitting but also standing while I’m studying. 
              And It gives better result on increasing my focus and my stability.

            <p class="question">
              Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would 
              try now and why ?
            </p>
            <p>
              This often happen in so many cases, for instance, on the last wedding event. I was the photographer and I just met the videographer on the day. We have not discussed a planning or meeting before the wedding day. 
              So on that day, instead of being egoistic with my shooting plan what I want to do, I communicate and ask him what his shot plannings were, and we both agreed on sort of shot list that we were going to shoot for the couple. 
              Therefore, I learn that we need to be flexible, open-minded, and good communication with whoever person we are working with, because at the end of the day we were trying to make the best outcome for the couple in the wedding.
