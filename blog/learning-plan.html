            <p class="question">
              What is your long term goal or career pathway ?
            </p>
            <p>At the moment, the career pathway that I will focus on is Front-End Developer mixed with UX Design. I have been dreaming to be a Visual Designer that has programming skill.

            <p class="question"> 
              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes learning process, my strength is I will try my best to solve problem that I encounter, for instance, trying to solve issue with the CSS. I really enjoy to learn and study if I find that subject is what I really like or passionate. My weekness is that I cannot focus or sitting in front of screen too long. Probably, every 20 minutes, I need go to walk or stay away from screen.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question">
              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </p>
            <p>
              Team work with other students in a project. How to work and solve problem together as a team and try to develop my communication with other student, how to communicate well my idea to them.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
            </p>
            <p>
              I will try to prioritise which one is needed to be done, a piece by piece, and  well-time management is important. If I find something hard or stuck, and try to solve it with my own If more than 10 minutes that I still cannot find the solution. I will ask facilitator to save time instead of sticking with the problem 1 hour, that’s not wise enough. 
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ll try to manage my time well enough to finish the projects on time with the deadline. Regarding on seeking help, I try to find best solutions, it could facilitator or online resources as well. With Facilitator I need to respect their time and also their effort. Therefore, I will ask specific problem to facilitator, not the whole problem.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, I got really supportive facilitator. It is great to have that care with their student’s well being and learning journey until the graduation.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

            <p class="question">
              What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
            </p>
            <p>
              My long term goal and career pathway is to become a front-end developer. I hope to use the skills I gain during Dev Academy's Bootcamp to build user-friendly and visually appealing websites and applications. My destination is to work for a company that values innovation and growth, and where I can continuously improve my skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
            </p>
            <p>
              During Foundations, I have discovered that I have a keen eye for detail and design. However, I also realized that I am just starting with coding and have much to learn in terms of technical skills in programming. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I think my strength for detail and design will be helpful during Bootcamp, but my lack of technical skills may make things difficult. I promise to try my best to improve my technical skills and not be afraid to ask for help when I need it. Also, I want to continue to make sure my work has good detail and design to bring special ideas to my future projects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe my biggest challenge during Bootcamp that is not about technical skills will be working with others in a group. I usually work alone and need to improve my skills for working with a team. I want to get better at working together with others and also at speaking clearly and understanding others.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to make myself better by learning leadership skills and being more conscious of myself and my actions. I also think it is important for me to get better at giving and receiving feedback, because I think these skills are very important for working well with others in a team.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope the Bootcamp team will be there to help me and give me direction throughout the program. I also want them to be there to answer any questions I have. I wish they will push me to do my best and reach my full potential by encouraging and motivating me.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="question">
              What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
            </p>
            <p>
              I will try to be proactive in asking for help when I need it, and to manage my work in a way that helps me be productive and safe with others in the program. This includes other learners, teachers, and people from industry and community. I also want to make sure to take care of myself and take breaks when needed, so I can stay focused and motivated throughout Bootcamp.
