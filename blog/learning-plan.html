            <p class="question">
              What is your long term goal or career pathway ?
            </p>
            <p>At the moment, the career pathway that I will focus on is Front-End Developer mixed with UX Design. I have been dreaming to be a Visual Designer that has programming skill.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes learning process, my strength is I will try my best to solve problem that I encounter, for instance, trying to solve issue with the CSS. I really enjoy to learn and study if I find that subject is what I really like or passionate. My weekness is that I cannot focus or sitting in front of screen too long. Probably, every 20 minutes, I need go to walk or stay away from screen.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question">
              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </p>
            <p>
              Team work with other students in a project. How to work and solve problem together as a team and try to develop my communication with other student, how to communicate well my idea to them.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
            </p>
            <p>
              I will try to prioritise which one is needed to be done, a piece by piece, and  well-time management is important. If I find something hard or stuck, and try to solve it with my own If more than 10 minutes that I still cannot find the solution. I will ask facilitator to save time instead of sticking with the problem 1 hour, that’s not wise enough. 
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ll try to manage my time well enough to finish the projects on time with the deadline. Regarding on seeking help, I try to find best solutions, it could facilitator or online resources as well. With Facilitator I need to respect their time and also their effort. Therefore, I will ask specific problem to facilitator, not the whole problem.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, I got really supportive facilitator. It is great to have that care with their student’s well being and learning journey until the graduation.
            </p><br>
            <p class="question"> 
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
            </p>
            <p>
