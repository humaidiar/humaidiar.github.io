            <p class="question">Neuroplasticity</p>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity  is a phenomenal characteristic of our brain that allows it to continuously evolve and adapt based on our experiences and actions. By utilizing this principle, you can enhance your cognitive abilities and improve overall brain function. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To engage with and increase neuroplasticity, I often challenge myself to learn new skills and engage in mentally stimulating activities. On the other hand, whenever I do regular exercise and mindfulness practices, it can also boost my brain's capacity for plasticity. Furthermore, making sure that I had enough sleep and seeking out new experiences , it can activate brain growth and change. By taking advantage of the power of neuroplasticity, you can unlock your brain's full potential and live a more fulfilling life.

            <p class="question">Growth Mindset</p>
            <p>
              Growth mindset refers to the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort and learning. It is relevant because having a growth mindset has been linked to greater resilience, improved performance, and increased satisfaction in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I believed that people with growth mindsets tend to approach challenges with a positive attitude and a belief in their own potential for growth, while those with a fixed mindset may give up easily and believe their abilities are set in stone. This is true, I experienced when Iâ€™m as photographer . I keep pushing myself to be better and better , and have positive attitude on how you look on obstacles along the journey because the hardship that I encountered it made me stronger and more experiences as professional photographer.
            </p>
            <p>
              One way to integrate growth mindset into my learning journey is to embrace challenges and view mistakes as opportunities for growth, rather than evidence of a lack of ability. Another way is to focus on the process of learning rather than just the outcome.
