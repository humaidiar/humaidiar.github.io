              EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is like a person's emotional "brain" or how well they can understand and control their own emotions and the emotions of others. It includes skills such as being able to understand how others feel and being able to control your own emotions.

              Furthermore, IQ (Intelligence Quotient)  measures how smart someone is, and how well they can think, learn and solve problems. EQ measures how well someone can understand, control and express their emotions, and how well they can connect and understand others' emotions. 
            </p>

              EQ is considered to be a vital skill in many areas of life, including personal relationships, leadership, teamwork, and conflict resolution. People with high EQ are often considered to be more effective communicators, problem solvers, and leaders, and are better equipped to handle stress and navigate the complexities of life.
